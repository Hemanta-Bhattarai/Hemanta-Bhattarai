## Experience

### University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN

```
Research Assistant 2015 – Current
```
* Developed a mathematical model for metals, (DR-EAM), and parameterized model parameters to capture most metals’ features. Performed molecular dynamics simulations of metals and alloys to tesy the validity of the model. Used the developed model to predict the different properties of metals and alloys.
* Modeled an energy surface for metal and water interaction and simulated the metal-water interface using the model. Studied transport properties at the interface using non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations and analyzed the orientation of water at the metal surface.
* Re-tuned DR-EAM parameters for Oxygen (DR-EAM.v2) to study the oxides’ formation and growth on the metal surface. Developed a new mixing rule for the intermolecular potentials of metals and oxygen in oxides.
* Developed different modules in OpenMD, (http://openmd.org), a molecular dynamics software developed and maintained by Gezelter’s Lab (http://gezelterlab.org). Implemented molecular dynamics algorithms and analysis scripts in C++, python, and bash. Trained new graduate studentsto use OpenMD.
