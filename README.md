# Hemanta Bhattarai's Personal Repository

## About Me:
Computational Physicist with 10+ years of experience in programming and scientific computing. Proficient in system modeling and validation. Expert in force field development and molecular dynamics simulations (equilibrium and non-equilibrium). Solid understanding of object-oriented programming and software development. Highly motivated to learn new skills.
## Repositories
1. [**dotFile**](https://github.com/Hemanta-Bhattarai/dotFile) : Configuration file for vim, tmux, bash shell.
2. [**OpenMD**](https://github.com/OpenMD/OpenMD): [OpenMD](http://openmd.org) is open source molecular dynamics engine maintained by [Gezelter lab](http://gezelterlab.org). It is written in C++ and Python. Basic required files to run the simulation using openmd are force field file `file_name.frc` and system file `system_name.omd`. The forcefield file contains all the information about the force field parameters used during simulations and .omd file contain the information about the system and ensemble used.
3. [**GOBAD1.0**](https://github.com/Hemanta-Bhattarai/GOBAD1.0): GOBAD1.0 is a package written in matlab and bash to analyze astronomical data to study the evolution of universe using spatial orientation of angular momentum of galaxies in a cluster.
4. [**Data science and ML projects**](https://github.com/Hemanta-Bhattarai/DataScience-ML-Projects):
